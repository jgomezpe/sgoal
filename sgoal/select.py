# Normalizes a vector of weights
def normalize(weight):
  c = 0
  for w in weight: 
    c += w
  return [ w/c for w in weight ]

# Gest the best index (position with the best quality value)
# Minimization version

############### SELECTION MECHANISMS ################
#### Uniform selection. Picks N elements (indices) with the same probability ####

#### Tournament selection. 
# Picks 4 individuals at random and returns the best one

# Selects 1 individual. ####
# Minimization version

  candidate = uniform(quality, m)
  x = 0
  for k in range(1,m):
    if(quality[candidate[x]] >= quality[candidate[k]]):
      x = k
  return candidate[x]

# Tournament selection. Selects N individuals.
# Uses tournament1 for each individual to be selected
# Minimization version
def min_tournament(quality, N):
  return [min_tournament1(quality) for i in range(N)]

# Tournament 1. Maximization version
def max_tournament1(quality):
  m = 4 #Tournament's size
  candidate = uniform(quality, m)
  x = 0
  for k in range(1,m):

# Uses tournament1 for each individual to be selected
# Maximization version
